sineSeq: A simple sequencer. 

To run the program, do the following: 
1.  Open miniAudicle
2.  Open the program sinseq.ck
3.  Start the virtual machine
4.  Click 'Add Shred', the green 'plus' button in the top left of the IDE.

Then we're rolling! 

Press the top-right-corner button to begin looping (or to pause/restart).  
The 0-th row blinks according to the loop position.

You begin in synth mode. 
- Each row (excluding the zero'th row, for the loop pos) provides a note in the major scale (in C major by default. You can change this by editing oscillator frequencies). 
- Press a button in the row to have that note play at the point in the sequence indicated by the column number. 

To switch to drum mode, hit the button to the left of the play/pause button.
This button toggles back and forth between modes to your heart's desire.
