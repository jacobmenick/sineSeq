# sinseq

A simple step sequencer built for a monome 128 with the chucK lanaguage. 

Incidentally, my first project with chucK and my first project for the monome.
The monome connection code is copied from life2013.ck, a conway's game implementation that I believe was done by tehn. 

There are two modes: synth mode and drum mode. 
- In synth mode, you can sequence a sine wave bleep for the 7 pitches of the major scale. 
- In drum mode, you can sequence a kick, hat, clap, and a few other sounds (7) in total.
