# sinseq

A simple step sequencer built for a monome 128 with the chucK lanaguage. 

Incidentally, my first project with chucK and my first project for the monome.
The monome connection code is copied from life2013.ck, a conway's game implementation that I believe was done by tehn. 

See help.txt for instructions.
